### Project todos:

[x] - Remove the addPt command.
When we pass the pt words to the addEn command, we can add a validation to create the pt word to the database if doesn't exist. The pt word would inherit the category from the english word. For that, we would have to add an obligatory option to the addEn command, -pt, that need to be an array of words with the same number of english words provided.
[x] - Learn how to install this project in the machine, so the user can execute it like a normal CLI command with the following - format: 'plt ...'.
[] - Create the game mode structure.
[] - All the code inside the actions functions, should be inside the controller.
